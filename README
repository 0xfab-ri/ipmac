ipmac netgraph node:

Stores (ip,mac) pairs in balanced binary tree (red-black)
for fast searching.

hooks:
in, match, mismatch, notfound, unknown

How it works:
Packets received on "in" hook are checked for ip/mac and forwarded to one of hooks:
match - if ip and mac matches
mismatch - ip found in tree, but mac not matches
notfound - ip not found in tree
unknown - unknown packet (proto is not ip, etc...)

Packets received on other hooks are discarded.

Usage example:

(vr0 - network interface)

mkpeer vr0: split lower mixed
name vr0:lower spl1
mkpeer vr0: split upper mixed
name vr0:upper spl2
connect spl1: spl2: in out

mkpeer spl2: one2many in one
name spl2:in o2m

mkpeer spl1: ipmac out in
name spl1:out ipmac
connect ipmac: o2m: match many1
connect ipmac: o2m: mismatch many2
connect ipmac: o2m: notfound many3
connect ipmac: o2m: unknown many4

Adding (ip,mac) pair:
msg ipmac: add { ip=1.2.3.4 mac=00:01:02:03:04:05 }

Statistics:
msg ipmac: stat

Clear internal tree:
msg ipmac: clear
